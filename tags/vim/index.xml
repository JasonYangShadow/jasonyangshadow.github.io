      <description>I uses wordpress as my private website while still struggling on finding different tools to write blogs remotely. I tried different tools including wordpress electron app here and vscode with extension &amp;ldquo;markdown-mail&amp;rdquo;, still gets no luck.
Wordpress desktop app is easy to setup and use, but it does not support markdown edit and preview, kind of disappoint. Markdown-mail is an extension published on vscode marketplace, I have tried it but gets no luck, it could not send my markdown doc to wordpress via email address.</description>
