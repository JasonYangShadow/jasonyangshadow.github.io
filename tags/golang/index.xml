      <description>Recently I am interested in the implementation and mechanics behind the scheduler in Go, as I just finished developing one job schedule system several days ago. Thougth I could not share more details on that system, it is simple and motives me to dig deeper into golang itself.
Found one really useful blog https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2018/08/scheduling-in-go-part1.html
Generally speaking, go scheduler is really amazing by trunning I/O blocking work into CPU-bound work at the os level and it has great performance over traditional implementation when programs have to trigger system calls frequently.</description>

      <description>An useful tool for my daily usage I use slack everyday, not only because it is required by our lab, but also it has good compatibilities acrossing different platforms(i.e, Linux, as I use Arch Linux as my main os). Long time ago, I developed notification system for telegram (an App similar to Slack), source code: https://github.com/JasonYangShadow/telegrambot, recently, as I keep working on writing golang code, I searched some documents and found that golang is an extremely good language for developing such notification system.</description>
