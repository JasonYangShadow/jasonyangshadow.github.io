      <description>Suppose we have a class:
public class Foo { public void first() { print(&amp;ldquo;first&amp;rdquo;); } public void second() { print(&amp;ldquo;second&amp;rdquo;); } public void third() { print(&amp;ldquo;third&amp;rdquo;); } }
The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads. Thread A will call first(), thread B will call second(), and thread C will call third(). Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that second() is executed after first(), and third() is executed after second().</description>

      <description>Recently I am interested in the implementation and mechanics behind the scheduler in Go, as I just finished developing one job schedule system several days ago. Thougth I could not share more details on that system, it is simple and motives me to dig deeper into golang itself.
Found one really useful blog https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2018/08/scheduling-in-go-part1.html
Generally speaking, go scheduler is really amazing by trunning I/O blocking work into CPU-bound work at the os level and it has great performance over traditional implementation when programs have to trigger system calls frequently.</description>
